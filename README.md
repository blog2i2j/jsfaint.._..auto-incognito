# Auto-Incognito

An extension for Google Chrome/Microsoft Edge that automatically opens websites in incognito mode.

## How to Use

Add the domain you want to open in incognito mode in the extension's popup page.
You can add it manually or use a button to add the current tab.

After adding the domain, the extension will automatically open the website in incognito mode.

There is also an option called 'private':
If this option is enabled, URLs in the blacklist will be opened in private mode.
If this option is disabled, URLs in the blacklist will be opened in normal mode. When the tab is closed, the history will be cleared.
